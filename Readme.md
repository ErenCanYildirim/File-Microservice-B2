## File Microservice - Python + Backblaze B2

A fully tested, production-ready file upload microservice built with **FastAPI**, **Celery**, **Redis**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Backblaze B2**.

Supports asynchronous file uploads, type and size validation, deduplication using file hashing, and cloud storage integration.

Backblaze B2 is cheaper than solutions such as S3 and GCS, and thus more reasonable for small-dev teams starting out on a project.

## Features

- ## Asynchronous file uploads with validation
- ## Metadata fields
- ## Retrieval endpoints with pagination and filtering
- ## Cloud storage using Backblaze B2
- ## Celery workers for async file upload processing
- ## Docker-Compose setup and ready
- ## 100% test coverage
